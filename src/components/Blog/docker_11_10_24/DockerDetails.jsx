				To begin learning Docker, we first need to address a fundamental
				question: why is Docker necessary?
				<h1>Prerequsities</h1>
				<br />
				<br />
				To get started with Docker containers on Windows, it's essential
				to have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed. WSL is a
				feature in Microsoft Windows that enables a native Linux
				environment without requiring a virtual machine or dual-boot
				setup. On Windows 11, WSL is installed by default, which
				streamlines the setup process. In this guide, weâ€™ll focus on
				using Docker Desktop on Windows 11, while also exploring how to
				work with Docker both with and without Docker Desktop.
